This is a level and leveldata editor for nodachi2D/heikiko2D and is supposed to
provide features for creating graphical content for games using nodachi2D/heikiko2D.

SFML is licensed under the libpng license and not my own work.

                                        ----
It is neccessary to get SFML and install it according to the following instructions:

posix:
you need to build it from source, and use --prefix=/usr i think. at least i had some problems when i set it up months ago.
If i remember correctly, the libsfml-*.so must go into /usr/lib, while building from source puts it into /usr/local/lib.

windows:
no idea. try getting the binaries, and probably put it into the project root folder and into the bin/debug and bin/release folders.
