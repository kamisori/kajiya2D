This is a level and leveldata editor for nodachi2D and is supposed to
provide features for creating graphical content for games using nodachi2D.


It is neccessary to get SFML and install it according to the following instructions:


					SFML
					----

posix:
you need to build it from source, and use --prefix=/usr i think. at least i had some problems when i set it up months ago.
If i remember correctly, the libsfml-*.so must go into /usr/lib, while building from source puts it into /usr/local/lib.

windows:
no idea. try getting the binaries, and probably put it into the project root folder and into the bin/debug and bin/release folders.



things to do:

main.cpp needs to be cleaned, or rewritten maybe. I still tend to rewrite it, even though it is very noodley...

- rewrite/redesign/clean main.cpp
- change the spacialObjects vector into a map with pair<x,y> as key and vector<object*>* as mapped value.
- use mouse as input device for editing, left click selects, right click does an action, middle click opens a context menu to select an action l+r clickhold pans the view

- creating a new spacialObject (select the material, select the visual appearance, place it.)
- removing a spacialObject

- creating a new material
- editing a material
- replacing a material
- removing a material

- scriptObjects: triggers: isTouched, touchedFromDirection, touchStart, touchEnd, contains, isActivated, isHold, isReleased, isStanding/Lying, isMidair, isFalling, isRising
- scriptID;materialID;visualAppearanceID;X;Y;
- scriptID;scriptFile;

- editing VisualAppearances
- editing Animations
