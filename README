this is a level and leveldata editor for nodachi2D and is supposed to
provide features for creating graphical content for games using nodachi2D.

main.cpp needs to be cleaned, or rewritten maybe. I still tend to rewrite it, even though it is very noodley...

things to do:
- rewrite/redesign/clean main.cpp
- change the spacialObjects vector into a map with pair<x,y> as key and vector<object*>* as mapped value.
- use mouse as input device for editing, left click selects, right click does an action, middle click opens a context menu to select an action l+r clickhold pans the view

- creating a new spacialObject (select the material, select the visual appearance, place it.)
- removing a spacialObject

- creating a new material
- editing a material
- replacing a material
- removing a material

- scriptObjects: triggers: isTouched, touchedFromDirection, touchStart, touchEnd, contains, isActivated, isHold, isReleased, isStanding/Lying, isMidair, isFalling, isRising
- scriptID;materialID;visualAppearanceID;X;Y;
