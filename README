It is neccessary to get SFML and install it according to the following instructions:


					SFML
					----

posix:
you need to build it from source, and use --prefix=/usr i think. at least i had some problems when i set it up months ago.
If i remember correctly, the libsfml-*.so must go into /usr/lib, while building from source puts it into /usr/local/lib.

windows:
no idea. try getting the binaries, and probably put it into the project root folder and into the bin/debug and bin/release folders.
